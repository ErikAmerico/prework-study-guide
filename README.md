# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Building a study guide website for this bootcamp was a great way to get familiar with the basic concepts of web development. Not only did I learn from the project, but i actually referred back to the study guide for help with Git.



## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Once on the study guide page you can read through notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and git to help you during the bootcamp.

When you inspect the page and look in the console, you will see a list of tops we covered and a specific topic for you to study first.
